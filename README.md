# C-Sharp-Practice
Reading tutorials online, I use this repository to test all the code I've learned

## Playground
These files are just me messing around in general, without following a specific structure

## project X_X
These folders follow a hierarchy based on complexity. project2_0 will be easier to understand than project5_0, for example. project2_1 will be similar to project2_0, but isn't complex enough to be under project3_0.
